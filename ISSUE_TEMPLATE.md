Thanks for contributing to [pgloader](https://pgloader.io) by reporting an
issue! Reporting an issue is the only way we can solve problems, fix bugs,
and improve both the software and its user experience in general.

The best bug reports follow those 3 simple steps:

  1. show what you did,
  2. show the result you got,
  3. explain how the result is not what you expected.

In the case of pgloader, here's the information I will need to read in your
bug report. Having all of this is a big help, and often means the bug you
reported can be fixed very efficiently as soon as I get to it.

Please provide the following information:

<!-- delete text above this line -->

  - [ ] pgloader --version
  
    ```
    <fill pgloader version here>
    ```
  
  - [ ] did you test a fresh compile from the source tree?
    
    Compiling pgloader from sources is documented in the
    [README](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader#build-from-sources), it's
    easy to do, and if patches are to be made to fix your bug, you're going
    to have to build from sources to get the fix anyway…
    
  - [ ] did you search for other similar issues?
    
  - [ ] how can I reproduce the bug?

    Include a self-contained pgloader command file.

    If you're loading from a database, consider attaching a database dump to
    your issue. For MySQL, use `mysqldump`. For SQLite, just send over your
    source file, that's easy. Maybe be the one with your production data, of
    course, the one with just the sample of data that allows me to reproduce
    your bug.
    
    When using a proprietary database system as a source, consider creating
    a sample database on some Cloud service or somewhere you can then give
    me access to, and see my email address on my GitHub profile to send me
    the credentials. Still open a public issue for tracking and as
    documentation for other users.
