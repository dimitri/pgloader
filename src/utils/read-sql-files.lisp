Here's a test case straigth from the PostgreSQL docs:

(with-input-from-string (s "
create function f(text)
   returns bool
   language sql
as $function$
BEGIN
    RETURN ($1 ~ $q$[\\t\\r\\n\\v\\\\]$q$);
END;
$function$;")
        (parse-query s (make-parser)))


Another test case for the classic quotes:

      (with-pgsql-connection ("pgsql:///pginstall")
        (query
         (with-input-from-string (s "select E'\\';' as \";\";")
           (parse-query s)) :alists))

      should return
      (((:|;| . "';")))
